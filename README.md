Since Airbnb was founded in 2008, it has become another Silicon Valley sensation. In 2019, they reported a number of 2.9 million hosts and in 2020 they generated revenue of $3.4 billion! I personally enjoy Airbnb and I love using it to find incredible rentals. It truly has everything and is undoubtedly better than the traditional hotel experience. It allows you to truly understand a city by living exactly like its locals.

This inspired me to analyze a dataset that contained information about listings. The data included information about price, review text, the property type, neighborhoods and so much more. So, I decided to analyze the data in three ways that I thought were most interesting:
### 1. A seasonal breakdown of prices and availability - In this, I determined which holidays were most expensive
### 2. A sentiment analysis of review text - In this, I did topic modeling with NMF and I determined polarity of reviews. I was able to determine that most reviews have a positive sentiment
### 3. A price predictor - In this, I performed extensive feature engineering to determine which factors were able to predict price the best. Then, I trained a neural network and recieved an r^2 value of 0.71 on my best neural net. I compared my results to a 2019 Stanford paper and found that they recieved an r^2 value of 0.74 with their best model.
